# Architecture Decisions

> This file logs key trade-offs and design decisions, one per phase. By day 7 it reads like a senior engineer's design log.

## Decision #1 — Why Go + TypeScript, and where the boundary sits

**Date:** Day 1  
**Decision:** Go for services that touch money directly (Ingestion, Decision Engine); TypeScript for services that touch external APIs and the dashboard (Execution, LLM Orchestrator, Dashboard).

**Reasoning:**
- Go's type safety and concurrency model are ideal for the policy layer — deterministic, testable, no runtime surprises when authorizing payment retries.
- TypeScript's ecosystem (Next.js for dashboard, Anthropic SDK for LLM, Razorpay's own TS SDK) makes the execution and orchestration layer faster to build.
- The boundary is clean: Go decides, TypeScript executes. The `action.schema.json` contract enforces this boundary at the data level, not just the architectural-diagram level.

**Trade-off acknowledged:** Running two language ecosystems in one repo adds operational complexity (two build pipelines, two dependency files per service). For a 7-day build, this is acceptable — the clarity of the Go/TS boundary is worth more than the simplicity of a single-language stack.
